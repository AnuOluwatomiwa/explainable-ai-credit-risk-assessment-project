# Explainable AI for Credit Risk Assessment Project

This repository contains resources for a project on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in credit risk assessment. It involves tracking dataset changes, documenting data preprocessing steps, and exploring how to build and understand AI models for credit risk.

Deployed using streamlit https://explainable-ai-credit-risk-assessment-project-ahm6yirrymqxnmwn.streamlit.app/

## Project Background
This project is my final year work for 2024, where I am focusing on implementing XAI techniques in credit risk assessment. The objective is to develop models that are both accurate and easy to explain, helping to shed light on the factors that drive credit risk decisions. This repository has a collection of datasets, scripts, and documentation related to the implementation.

## Structure
- `data/`: This directory houses the datasets. Each version of the dataset is stored with a unique version number in its name.
- `documentation/`: This section contains notes on data preprocessing, feature creation, and other relevant topics.
- `scripts/`: This is where you'll find code for data manipulation, feature creation, and other tasks.

## Data Versioning Approach
To track changes to the datasets, I am using [Git](https://git-scm.com/). This helps keep a record of changes over time, with descriptive commit messages explaining what has been done. Tagging is used to mark important points in the project's development.

## Data Preparation Process
When working with the data, I am applying the following steps:
- **Cleaning**: This involves dealing with duplicates, filling in missing values, and correcting inconsistencies.
- **Normalization**: This step ensures numerical features have consistent scales.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new data features based on domain insights.
- **Encoding**: Converting categorical variables into numerical formats where needed.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/explainable-ai-credit-risk-project.git
